Honey stop to yell like an animal (animal)
Story, you and me, it's so criminal (criminal)
Switch your volume to the minimal (minimal)
I believe your shit, like it's subliminal
Honey stop to yell like an animal (animal)
Story, you and me, it's so criminal (criminal)
Switch your volume to the minimal (ay)
I believe your shit, like it's subliminal
Like it's subliminal, like it's subliminal
I believe your shit like it's subliminal
Like it's subliminal, like it's subliminal
I, I believe your shit like it's subliminal

Stop
Where were you when I was falling down?
How would you trade the love, you played for fun?
I heard from time to time
And all I want
To be happy with my family
This stupid love
Maybe, it's my jealousy
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh
You didn't love when I was simple
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh
You loved my money and fame but never me
Na, na, na, ta-ra, ta-da, money and fame but never me
Na, na, na, ta-ra, na, na, money and fame but never me

Honey stop to yell like an animal (animal)

Switch your volume to the minimal (minimal)
I believe your shit, like it's subliminal

I believe your shit like it's subliminal
Like it's subliminal, like it's subliminal
I, I believe your shit like it's subliminal
